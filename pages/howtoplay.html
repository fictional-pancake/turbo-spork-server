	Each game starts with $[NODES_PER_USER_AT_START] nodes for each player and $[UNCLAIMED_NODES_AT_START] gray neutral nodes.  Each node generates units.  You can send units to another node by clicking the source, then the destination.

	If a single player's units occupy a node for $[TRANSFORM_TIME/] seconds, it will become theirs and start generating units for them.

	If two players have units on a node, they will fight to the death.  Once all units on the board belong to a single player, that player wins.
